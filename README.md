vertx-ui
===

A [Vert.X](http://vertx.io/) optimised pure-Java UI toolkit with unnoticable-fast server-time Java to Javascript translation (by [TeaVM](http://teavm.org/)), and a fluid HTML toolkit. The Vert.X eventbus does not only stretchs all the way inside your browser (by websockets with sockjs), but now also in the same programming language.

The server-time translation works at server startup time so you don't need to set up any Maven/IDE tools. You don't even need file access at runtime, which makes vert-x ideal as minimal microservice. Heck, remember you don't need to setup Apache or Tomcat too because you're using Vert.X which can [handle thousands of connections per core](https://dzone.com/articles/inside-vertx-comparison-nodejs). Using Java instead of Javascript means strong-typing, direct binding with entity classes, convenient tooling, easy junit testing, and both the Java ánd the JavaScript ecosystems under your fingertips.

Server-time translation does not mean you can not debug your code. To debug, set the VertxUI debug parameter to true, run your code, press CTRL+S in your IDE (to trigger auto-compilation) and VertxUI will translate the classfiles to javascript when you refresh the browser.

### Serverside

The serverside is easy. This single line serves all necessary front-end Javascript code including the necessary (single-lined) wrapping HTML, ready to be shown in the browser.

    router.route("/client").handler(new VertxUI(Client.class, false, true));

Vert.X comes with HTTP compression out of the box so there is no need to do anything else except turning HTTP compression on (see all examples). The hello-world example translates from java to javascript within a second server startup time, and that results in 68kb dependency-less javascript+html, or in 16kb HTTP-zipped javscript+html.


### Clientside pure DOM

The clientside looks like plain javascript but then with Java (8's lambda) callbacks. This is pure 
[TeaVM](http://teavm.org/).

		HTMLButtonElement helloButton = document.createElement("button").cast();
		helloButton.setAttribute("id", "hello-button");
		helloButton.setInnerHTML("Click me");
		helloButton.listenClick(evt -> clicked());
		body.appendChild(helloButton);
		...
		
	private void clicked() {
		helloButton.setDisabled(true);
		thinkingPanel.getStyle().setProperty("display", "");
		...
	}

## Clientside fluid HTML

You can also use fluid HTML, which is a lot shorter and more readable.

		Button button = body.button("Click me").id("hello-button").onClick(evt -> clicked());
		...
		
	private void clicked() {
		button.disable();
		thinkingPanel.css("display", "");
		...
	}


## EventBus websocket at server and client in pure java 


This project is just a few weeks old - so hang on. I hope to have the eventbus access ready very very soon, it doesn't look that difficult to wrap an existing javascript API inside TeaVM.

A scetch I wrote before I started:

    public class Client extends VertxUI {
    
	// Model (inline as demonstration)
	public class Model {
		public String user;
		public String password;
	}
	
	private Model model = new Model();
	
	private Div title;
	
	public Client() {
		Html body = Html.body();
		
		// View
		Div title = body.div("<h1>Bla</h1>");
		Form form = body.form()
			.input("user", model.user, i -> {
			model.user = i;
		}).input("password", i -> {
			model.password = i;
		}).input("SEND", null, () -> {
			form.send();
		});
	
		// View-Controller binding
		form.post(GUI::send);
    	
		eventBus().register("response", GUI::receive);
	}
	
	// Controller
	private static void send(JsonObject updated) {
		eventBus().wrap("login", updated);
		title.inner("<h1>Sent!</h1>");
	}
	
	private void receive(JsonObject received) {
		title.inner("Received from the server: "+received);
	
	  }
    }
