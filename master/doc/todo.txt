Development:
- finish mvcBootstrap/ virtualDOM   https://medium.com/@deathmood/how-to-write-your-own-virtual-dom-ee74acc13060#.wc4ze6sj1
- test and examplify Eventbus object-json-object: not publish/consumer but send->reply, and class-independant
- create http://todomvc.com
- split in vertxui-server vertxui-client and vertxui-examples
- announce at vertx-awesome github list and GWT list and elsewhere


- mail vertx:
	- only one websocket possible?
	- no way to detect which user has sended: EventBusBridgeImpl::checkAndSend())
	- a send goes to the last one that joined (either server or chatter)
	- why not a CDN version?
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vert-x3/vertx-bus-bower/master/vertx-eventbus.js
			https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/sockjs/1.1.1/sockjs.min.js
	- updated to sockjs 1.1.1?
